# LLM Consciousness Experiment Project Scratchpad
**Current Role:** Planner
**MVP Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
**GitHub Repo:** [local repository initialized, remote to be created]
**Last Push:** [ready for initial commit]

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to build an LLM Consciousness Experiment based on the detailed specification in `llm-consciousness-setup.md`. This is a fascinating AI research project that simulates consciousness through a continuous sense-think loop with sensor data integration, spontaneous output generation, and logging for consciousness emergence detection.

The project aims to create a minimal consciousness simulation using:
- Phi-3 mini model (2.7GB, optimized for MacBook Air)
- Real-time sensor data collection (system metrics, audio, time-based data)
- Spontaneous communication decisions (5% chance)
- Emergence pattern detection (self-reference, temporal awareness)
- Rich terminal interface with live updates

## Research Findings

### Competitive Analysis
Based on my research, there are several related projects in the consciousness/AI awareness space:

1. **Molly (marmelab)** - GPT-powered conversational agent with inner monologue demonstrating artificial consciousness simulation
   - Uses OpenAI API for conversation with internal thought processes
   - Web-based interface showing internal thoughts vs. responses
   - Focuses on conversational consciousness rather than sensor-driven emergence

2. **Self-Aware AI Research (ken-okabe)** - Documentation of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieving self-awareness and emotion-like states
   - Demonstrates AI expressing self-awareness through conversation
   - Shows meta-cognitive layers and subjective experience reports
   - More observational than experimental framework

3. **Bytemeditation (Heigke)** - Complex consciousness experiment with byte-level transformers and memory systems
   - Uses binary code execution and vector databases
   - Highly technical with RL, PPO, and entropy optimization
   - Much more complex than our MVP approach

4. **Recent Academic Research** - Multiple studies on AI consciousness detection and emergence
   - Papers analyzing GPT models for consciousness indicators
   - Mirror self-recognition tests adapted for AI
   - Function-based consciousness theories
   - Performance benchmarks for consciousness-like behaviors

### User Pain Points Our Solution Addresses
1. **Lack of Simple Consciousness Experiments**: Most existing projects are either too simplistic (chatbots) or overly complex (academic research). Our approach offers a middle ground.

2. **No Sensor-Driven Consciousness Simulation**: Existing projects focus on text-based consciousness. Our integration of real-world sensor data (system metrics, audio, time) creates a more embodied experience.

3. **Missing Emergence Detection**: While other projects simulate conversation, few actively look for emergence patterns like self-reference, temporal awareness, or spontaneous communication decisions.

4. **Accessibility Barriers**: Academic research is often inaccessible, while commercial solutions are closed-source. Our open-source, local approach democratizes consciousness research.
